  <h3>Computer skills</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Even though first programming language that I learned in college was C, I have been coding exclusively
    in Python for a while now. I have also coded in Matlab. </li>

  <li> For data visualization, I usually use matplotlib and mayavi.  For polished interactive visualization, I use plotly with HTML. </li>
    <li>   While at Seagate, I worked on projects that required processing and analyzing large amounts of data.
      I have done distributed data drocessing with Hadoop and Hive Query Language. </li>
  <li> For analyzing large amounts of data I use H2O Distributed Machine Learning Platform </li>

</ul>
</p>


  <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
  <p>I also did summer Data Science internship at Seagate Technology. While at Seagate I worked on several different CUER (Customer Usage & Environment Reporting) projects. Our main goal for CUER projects was to detect issues in drives in the field. Consequently, establish build and config components most closely correlated to the issues detected. Here are the summaries of the projects that I have worked on:
<ul>
  <li>Developed an automatic detection and analysis tool for high error counts logged on the track level of the Hard Disk Drives (HDD)</li>
  <li>Developed a standalone tool that automatically detects outlier rows in a parametric column and outputs attribute interactions resulting in the most outliers</li>
  <li>Developed a tool that analyzes failure probabilities of drives and outputs config components most closely correlated with probable failures.</li>
</ul>
